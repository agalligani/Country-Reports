Country Reports is a contrib module for Drupal 7.x which is under development.

The purpose of Country Reports is to add a content type which will allow a user to create customized maps
of a specified country along with accompanying information regarding that country. I am stealing from node_example
from example modules.

The map of the country in question will be based on the google charts API map making feature.

This module is currently under development. It is not useful at all at this point.
